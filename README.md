AI-powered CNN model to detect brain tumors from MRI scans
# 🧠 AI-Powered Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Scans

This is a beginner-level deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The project is built using Python and TensorFlow, trained on a public Kaggle dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📚 Dataset: Brain MRI scans from Kaggle
- 🛠️ Model: CNN with TensorFlow/Keras
- 🎯 Goal: Classify images as tumor or no-tumor
- 💾 Output: Trained model saved as `.h5`, and optionally exported to ONNX
